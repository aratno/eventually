All the projects I wish I could start now...

I find myself thinking of projects much faster than I can write them down, let alone start them. Rather than let these ideas evaporate, I've decided to collect them into a repository where others looking for a challenge can give them a shot. That being said, none of them are meant to be especially challenging.
